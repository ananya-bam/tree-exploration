I implemented the unified TreeInterface.java interface that includes the contains, size, insert, get, \
remove, and toString methods, and then I made BSTPrinceton, AVLPrinceton, RedBlackTree, 
SplayTree, SkipList, and MinHeap implement the interface by ensuring they implemented all of 
the methods in the interface. I also created a Tester.java that tests each of the trees + MinHeap 
and checks the methods. I continued to use the Key, Value methodology. This assignment was useful to 
practice my implementation of interfaces and learn more about the different types of trees.
